# RFTS Platform — Project Status & Where We Left Off

Use this file to get up to speed when opening the project in the **rfts-platform** folder or starting a new chat.

## What This Project Is

**Reach For The Stars (RFTS)** — A wellness platform with:
- Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Vercel Postgres, Stripe, Vercel Blob
- Member signup flow (subscription selection → personal details → payment)
- Admin (content, users, moderators, subscriptions, playback settings)
- Moderation workflow, affiliates, library, facilitator pages

App code lives in **rfts-platform** (this folder). The repo root is **CursorRFTS** (parent), which also has Marketing docs, products.csv, and Cursor agent rules.

## What We Did in This Session

### 1. Restored Cursor “agent” / project rules
- **Problem:** No `.cursor` or agent instructions — the project had no persistent AI context.
- **Done:** Created at repo root (CursorRFTS):
  - **`.cursor/rules/project-agent.mdc`** — Always-on rule: stack, layout (API, pages, components, lib), conventions, types.
  - **`AGENTS.md`** — Short agent instructions: work in rfts-platform, follow project rule, preserve patterns.
- **Note:** If you open only **rfts-platform** as the workspace, those files are in the parent folder; you can still open the repo root to get them, or copy/adapt rules into rfts-platform if you want everything self-contained here.

### 2. Centered the membership package on member signup
- **Problem:** “Select Your Membership Package” and the plan card were left-aligned on the signup page.
- **Done:**
  - **`src/app/globals.css`**
    - Added **`.signup-card .membership-package-section`** — flex column, `align-items: center`, so the whole membership block is centered.
    - **`.plan-grid`** — Switched to flex with `justify-content: center` (was grid).
    - **`.plan-card`** — `flex: 0 0 auto`, `max-width: 720px`, `min-width: 0` so the card doesn’t stretch and stays centered.
  - **`src/components/MemberOnboarding.tsx`** — Wrapped “Select Your Membership Package” heading + plan grid in `<div className="membership-package-section">`.
  - **`src/components/SubscriptionSelection.tsx`** — Same wrapper for consistency.
- **Result:** The single “Membership Package” card is centered on the signup page.

### 3. GitHub / Git
- **Tried:** Pushing to GitHub from this chat — **not possible** here (Git not available in this environment).
- **Status:** The **CursorRFTS** folder still had **no `.git`** as of last check — the project was not yet a Git repository.
- **Your path:** Use **GitHub Desktop** to create/add the repo and push:
  - Either: **File → New Repository** with Local Path = `…\miller-engine\CursorRFTS` (or the parent of rfts-platform).
  - Or: Initialize in Cursor (**Ctrl+Shift+P** → “Git: Initialize Repository” in CursorRFTS), then **File → Add Local Repository** in GitHub Desktop and point to that same folder.
  - Then commit and **Push origin** / **Publish repository**.

## Where We Left Off

- **Code:** Admin library category filter, schedule filtering by adult/Special, and user-assigned CGMR in rotation are implemented. Adult content remains enforced in LibraryBrowser, stream route, and schedule (no birthdate or under 18 → no adult).
- **Git:** Repo not yet initialized in CursorRFTS at last check; push to GitHub is done by you via GitHub Desktop (or Cursor’s Source Control once Git is set up).
- **Next steps you might want:**
  - Initialize Git in the repo root (CursorRFTS) and push to GitHub via GitHub Desktop.
  - If you open only **rfts-platform** as the workspace, consider adding a `.cursor/rules` or short CONTEXT.md here that points to this file so new chats “know where we left off.”

- **Latest session (admin audios & schedule):** AdminContent has category filter (All/General/Special/CGMR). Schedule API filters library by adult and Special access, uses member profile (yearBorn, adultConsent, wantsPracticeGrowth), and passes user-assigned CGMR into the scheduler for the special slot. Scheduler accepts optional `userAssignedTrack`. Adult content is not viewable without birthdate or if under 18 (LibraryBrowser, stream route, schedule).

## Quick Reference for the Agent

- **App entry:** `src/app/` (App Router); API routes under `src/app/api/`.
- **Types:** `src/lib/types.ts`.
- **Signup flow:** `src/app/signup/step-1-subscription-selection/page.tsx` uses `MemberOnboarding`; subscription UI is in `MemberOnboarding.tsx` and `SubscriptionSelection.tsx`; styles in `src/app/globals.css` (`.signup-card`, `.membership-package-section`, `.plan-grid`, `.plan-card`).
- **DB/schema:** `scripts/schema.sql` for Vercel Postgres; env in `.env.local` (see README).
